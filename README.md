Overview
========

This readme documents the current (development) version of distributive.

Distributive is a tool for running distributed health checks in datacenters.
It was designed with Consul in mind, but is platform agnostic.  The architecture
is such that some external server will ask the host to execute this program,
reading in from some JSON file, and will record this
program's exit code and standard out.

The exit code meanings are defined as [Consul] [1] and [Sensu] [2] recognize
them.

 * Exit code 0 - Checklist is passing
 * Exit code 1 - Checklist is warning
 * Any other code - Checklist is failing

As of right now, only exit codes 0 and 1 are used, even if a checklist fails.

Installation and Usage
======================

Installation
------------
To install the development version (potentially unstable):
 1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/CiscoCloud/distributive`
 2. Build a binary: `cd distributive && go build .`
 3. Run the binary (as outlined in "Usage") with `./distributive`.

We also provide premade RPM packages on
[Bintray](https://bintray.com/ciscocloud/rpm/Distributive/view#files). The
binary will be installed to `/bin/distributive` and the samples to
`/usr/share/distributive/samples/`.

Usage
-----

```
$ distributive --help
Usage of ./distributive:
  -f="": Use the health check JSON located at this path
  -v=1: Output verbosity level (valid values are [0-3])
     0: (Default) Display only errors, with no other output.
     1: Display errors and some information.
     2: Display everything that's happening.
```

Examples:

```
$ /path/to/distributive -v=2 -f ./samples/filesystem.json
$ distributive -f /usr/share/distributive/samples/network.json -v=0
```

Supported Frameworks
--------------------

Distributive attempts to be as framework-agnostic as possible. It is known to
work well with both Sensu and Consul, which have similar architecture with
regards to their health checks. There is documentation for how to use
Distributive with Consul on this project's
[Github wiki](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/distributive/wiki/Working-with-Consul).

Checks
=======

Distributive provides dozens of checks ranging from CPU core temperature to
TCP connection timeouts. For the impatient, examples of every single implemented
check are available in the `samples/` directory, sorted by category. There
is extensive documentation for each check available on this project's
[Github wiki](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/distributive/wiki).


Dependencies
============

Distributive itself has no dependencies, it is compiled as a standalone Go
binary. Some checks, however, rely on output from specific packages. These
dependencies are outlined for each check on this project's
[Github wiki](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/distributive/wiki/Checks-and-Checklists).

Comparison to Other Software
============================

Distributive was created with the idea of pushing responsibiliy to the nodes,
which grants the program a certain flexibility in what kind of checks it can run.
It has access to local data that cannot or should not be accessed over a network,
by another server. It was also designed around the idea of constantly changing
infrastructure, with servers being added and destroyed constantly, and changing
IP addresses.

Serverspec
----------

Serverspec runs on a single control server, and requires each check to be in a
directory matching the hostname of the machine to run it on. Distributive was
designed for dynamic systems with changing IPs, which can report into Consul,
Sensu, or another framework as soon as they are ready, and require little or no
centralized configuration. Additionally, Distributive attempts to rely as little
as possible on external tools/commands, using mostly just the Go standard library.

Nagios
------

Nagios is an end-to-end monitoring, security, and notification framework. It is
designed around the central control server approach to monitoring. Nagios provides
many other services not included in Distributive, but may not be suitable for
some projects due to its size, complexity, and centralized architecture.
Distributive is simple, lightweight, and easy to configure, and doesn't provide
its own scheduling, dashboard, etc. It is designed to be used within frameworks
such as Sensu and Consul.
