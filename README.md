Overview
========

This readme documents the current (development) version of distributive.

Distributive is a tool for running distributed health checks in datacenters.
It was designed with Consul in mind, but is platform agnostic. It is simple
to configure (with JSON checklists) and easy to deploy and run. It has no
dependencies, and can be shipped as a speedy 4MB (yes, megabytes!) binary.

Usually, some external server will ask the host to execute this program, reading
a checklist from a JSON file, and will record this program's exit code and
standard out. Distributive's output includes information about which checks
in a checklist failed, and how so.

The exit code meanings are defined as [Consul] [1] and [Sensu] [2] recognize
them.

 * Exit code 0 - Checklist is passing
 * Exit code 1 - Checklist is warning
 * Any other code - Checklist is failing

As of right now, only exit codes 0 and 1 are used, even if a checklist fails.

Installation and Usage
======================

Installation
------------
To install the development version (potentially unstable):
 1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/CiscoCloud/distributive`
 2. Build a binary: `cd distributive && go build .`
 3. Run the binary (as outlined in "Usage") with `./distributive`.

We also provide premade RPM packages on
[Bintray](https://bintray.com/ciscocloud/rpm/Distributive/view#files). The
binary will be installed to `/bin/distributive` and the samples to
`/etc/distributive/samples/`.

Usage
-----

The default behavior is to run all checks in /etc/distributive.d/, in addition
to any specified via the `-f` or `-u` options.

```
$ distributive --help
Usage of ./distributive:
  -a="/etc/distributive.d/": Run all the checks in the specified directory
  -f="": Use the health check located at this path
  -u="": Use the health check located at this URL
  -v=1: Output verbosity level (valid values are [0-2])
     0: Display only errors, with no other output.
     1: Display errors and some information.
     2: Display everything that's happening.
  -version=false: Get the version of distributive this binary was built from
```

Examples:

```
$ /path/to/distributive -v=2 -f ./samples/filesystem.json
$ distributive -v=0 -a="" --f="/etc/distributive/samples/network.json"
$ ./distributive -a="" -u "http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=5c1BAxcX"
$ /distributive
$ /path/to/distributive -a "/etc/distributive.d/"
```

Supported Frameworks
--------------------

Distributive attempts to be as framework-agnostic as possible. It is known to
work well with both Sensu and Consul, which have similar architecture with
regards to their health checks. There is documentation on how to use
Distributive with Consul on this project's
[Github wiki](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/distributive/wiki/Working-with-Consul).

Checks
=======

Distributive provides dozens of checks ranging from CPU core temperature to
TCP connection timeouts. For the impatient, examples of every single implemented
check are available in the `samples/` directory, sorted by category. There
is extensive documentation for each check available on this project's
[Github wiki](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/distributive/wiki).


Dependencies
============

Distributive itself has no dependencies; it is compiled as a standalone Go
binary. Some checks, however, rely on output from specific packages. These
dependencies are outlined for each check on this project's
[Github wiki](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/distributive/wiki/Checks-and-Checklists).

Comparison to Other Software
============================

Distributive was created with the idea of pushing responsibiliy to the nodes,
which grants the program a certain flexibility in what kind of checks it can run.
It has access to local data that cannot or should not be accessed over a network.
It was also designed around the idea of constantly changing infrastructure, with
servers being added and destroyed constantly, changing IP addresses, and even
changing roles. Integration with Consul [provides greater flexibility](https://www.consul.io/intro/vs/nagios-sensu.html).

Serverspec
----------

Serverspec runs on a single control server, and requires each check to be in a
directory matching the hostname of the machine to run it on. Distributive was
designed for dynamic systems with changing IPs, which can report into Consul,
Sensu, or another framework as soon as they are ready, and require little or no
centralized configuration. Additionally, Distributive attempts to rely as little
as possible on external tools/commands, using mostly just the Go standard library.

Nagios
------

Nagios is an end-to-end monitoring, security, and notification framework. It
provides many services not included in Distributive, and solves a very different
problem.  Distributive is simple, lightweight, and easy to configure, and
doesn't provide its own scheduling, dashboard, etc. It is designed to be used
within frameworks such as Sensu and Consul. Luckily, Distributive can easily
be used with Consul to provide data to Nagios, for a sweet combination.
